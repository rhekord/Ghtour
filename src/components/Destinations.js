The national park covers an area of 375 square kilometres (145 sq mi) and includes the most intact virgin rainforest in Ghana.

The park is located in the southern parts of Ghana, precisely in the Central Region of Ghana. It is about 33 kilometres (21 mi) north of Cape Coast and Elmina near the Assin Atandanso village."
